##100/100 The code works very well. I learned a lot of python and it was very easy to pick up. A lot of the things i did were simple but the more complex parts I used the documentation and online forums like open stacks or openCV for help.
##14. Why are some channels more affected visually by noise than others?
##The range of the values in the RBG or for OpenCV GBR can change the way noise interacts, if some colors are darker or some are lighter the image will interact differently when noise is applied, it all depends on the colors on the image.
##HW2 95/100 The code works pretty good. Some of the code is not perfect, like the noisy and the real signs I could only get partially, and there are some things that didn't work that well, and I couldn't implement, like the traffic signs not all being detected and it only detects one of the lit ones. This fix to this could be changing the wrapper, but that was something I don't know if I could change. I did use track bars that helped a lot, and it made things a lot easier to understand.
